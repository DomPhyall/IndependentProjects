                    <p class="article-body">As a general rule, you can classify foods as either acid-forming or 
                        alkaline forming. The standard American diet is completely acid-forming, rich in acid-forming
                        meat, dairy and highly processed foods. Your body’s pH is 7.35, or slightly alkaline. 
                        Your body constantly seeks balance and works hard to maintain the healthy neutral alkaline zone. 
                        While the foods you eat cannot change this zone, your body must compensate for a high intake of acid-forming
                        foods by leaching calcium (an alkalizing mineral) from your bones.</p>
